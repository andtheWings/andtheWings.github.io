Skylight
========

*by Pinegrove*

i move through shadow
i go they go wherever
don’t they come in
whenever i let em

i climb through
the skylight
whatever you’re feeling is alright
let you
let go
whatever you're feeling is natural

low light at dawn
i'll love that song forever
it's a shadow
let me know me better

i climb through
the skylight
whatever you’re feeling is alright
let me
let go
whatever you're feeling is natural
whatever you're feeling is natural

let me let go
let me know me better

i climb through
the skylight
whatever you're feeling is alright
let me
let go
whatever you're feeling is natural
whatever you're feeling is natural
